# billTotal

Write a function called billTotal that can be used to calculate the total to be paid at a restaurant -- including tip and tax -- given the subtotal (i.e. cost of food and drinks). We can assume that the tip will be 15% and tax will be 9.5%. Make sure that the tip does not include the tax!

- input: a number representing the cost of food and drinks
- output: a number representing that cost plus an additional 15% tip and tax of 9.5%
